My name is yana with matrix number, 23005006. I am majoring in Information System. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 
At the moment, I am feeling terrified about taking this subject. This is because i have been exposed to the upmost possibilities to fail this subject and my FOP last sem was not as what i was expecting it will be.
I acquired X for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s too bad that i felt almost zero confidence. 
So, I think I can manage to get B for this DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will extremely work 5000% harder . Wish me luck!!! 



Hello, it's me again. I've been doing pretty well lately. 
i'm not saying my perfomance was the best as compared with the others but truthfully i'm trying to accept what i had gave into course. 
DS has taught me a lot of things like how to come up with a lot of ways to solve the question. 
i must say this course is very hard and i'm on the verge of tears everytime i encountered questions. 
i dont like to change the target because its the minimum grade that i can accept but maybe at least B-, that will be the end of it and i dont want to think i could get C because i dont want to. 
i have been managing to tackle at least bare minimum concept and im very proud myself. 
i was hopefull that i could tackle the quetions easier or come up with solution much more faster that i'm now
