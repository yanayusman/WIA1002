My name is yana with matrix number, 23005006. I am majoring in Information System. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 
At the moment, I am feeling terrified about taking this subject. This is because i have been exposed to the upmost possibilities to fail this subject and my FOP last sem was not as what i was expecting it will be.
I acquired X for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s too bad that i felt almost zero confidence. 
So, I think I can manage to get B for this DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will extremely work 5000% harder . Wish me luck!!!
